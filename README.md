# WishLib---Backend
An app to create and save a wishlist of books. Books already readed or in wishlist to read can be added.

# v1.0

# What to (users)
[] User can create an account (name, e-mail, password, age, description?)
[] User can log in
[] User has two lists: already readed books and wish to read books
[] User can add new books or remove a book from any list
[] User can mark a book in wishlist as already readed book


# What to (books)
[] There's a books database
[] Books have title, author, genre, description, edition?
[] Books must have a "already readed" flag.



# Future work
[] User can create more personal lists (romances wish lists, fiction already readed, etc)
[] Use a database or even an API to get data from the books, so the user just find the book, not add them every time
